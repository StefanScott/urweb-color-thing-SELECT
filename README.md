# urweb-color-thing-SELECT

The code in this repo is similar to an earlier, simpler, working repo [`urweb-color-thing-THING`](https://github.com/StefanScott/urweb-color-thing-T) except:

- This code attempts to provide an HTML5 <select> element, containing <option> elements, in order to let the user select the foreign-key field `thing.Color`.

However, the code in *this* repo DOES NOT compile.

The compile errors for this repo are shown in in [Issue 1](https://github.com/StefanScott/urweb-color-thing-SELECT/issues/1).

Thanks for any help!
